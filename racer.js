// Strata expects you to check that the page you've received from
// `Strata.search` has not changed in the time it took for you to resolve the
// `Promise` returned by search. By changed we mean that that the structure of
// the b-tree has not changed â€” the tree has not been rebalanced. Your search is
// in a race against Strata's balancer, which may decide to split the page, so
// that the key you sought is not on a different page, or merge the page so that
// the page your looking at is now deleted.
//
// Strata asks that you always use `Cursor.indexOf` to find the record, even
// after a return from `search`. `Cursor.indexOf` will return the index for the
// key in the page or `null` if the page is no longer the correct page for the
// key. The `search` method only searches for the page where the key belongs,
// where it should be.  When strata descends the tree, it doesn't actually
// perform the final binary search in the leaf page, it leaves that up to you.
//
// Unit tests for  will be impossible without the means to delay the return from
// `Strata.search`, so we've created `Racer`, a wrapper around `Strata` that
// will let you test your defenses against race conditions. Fortunately, this is
// all you need to test for race conditions. Your code should retry if
// `Cursor.indexOf` returns null, so your tests can delay the return of a search
// for a key, then split or merge the page so that `Cursor.indexOf` return
// `null`.
//
// A reminder that Strata is a b-tree primitive. It's not meant to be a
// database, but a building block for databases.
