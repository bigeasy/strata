// An evented I/O b&#x2011;tree for Node.js.
//
// TK Define ***least child page***.
//
// ## Purpose
//
// Strata stores JSON objects on disk, according to a sort order of your
// choosing, indexed for fast retrieval.
//
// Strata is faster than a flat file and lighter than a database, with more
// capacity than an in&#x2011;memory tree.
//
// Strata is a [b&#x2011;tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)
// implementation for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) that is **evented**,
// **concurrent**, **persistent** and **durable**.
//
// Strata is **evented**. It uses asynchronous I/O to read and write
// b&#x2011;tree pages, allowing your CPU to continue to do work while Strata
// waits on I/O.
//
// Strata is **concurrent**. Strata will answer any queries from its
// in&#x2011;memory cache when it can, so requests can be satisfied even when
// there are evented I/O requests outstanding.
//
// Strata is **persistent**. It stores your tree in page files. The page files
// are plain old JSON text files that are easy to manage. You can view them
// with `less` or `tail -f`, back them up hot using `rsync`, and version them
// with `git`.
//
// Strata is **durable**. It only appends records to a file, so a hard shutdown
// will only ever lose the few last records added. Pages are journaled when they
// are vacuumed or rewritten.
//
// Strata is a b&#x2011;tree. A b&#x2011;tree is a database primitive. Using
// Strata, you can start to experiment with database designs of your own. You
// can use Strata to build an MVCC database table, like PostgreSQL. You can
// create Strata b&#x2011;trees to create indexes into structured data that is
// not already in a database, like monster log files. You can use Strata to
// store your data in what ever form of JSON suits you, like a NoSQL database.
//
// As a bonus, Strata is two database primitives in one, because with a time
// series index, you can use Strata as a write&#x2011;ahead log.
//
// Strata runs anywhere that Node.js runs, in pure JavaScript.
//
// ## Collaboration
//
// Documentation for Strata is presented here, in literate programming style.
// API documentation is not yet available, so scoot down to the `Strata` class
// for an in-depth look at the API. Have a look at the extensive test suite for
// examples on the different operations.
//
// If you find a bug with Strata, please report it at the [GitHub
// Issues](https://github.com/bigeasy/strata/issues). If you want to leave a
// comment on the documentation or the code, you can ping me, Alan Gutierrez, at
// @[bigeasy](https://twitter.com/#!/bigeasy) on Twitter.
//
// Feel free to fork and explore. Note that Strata is a database primitive, not
// a database in itself. Before you fork and add features you feel are missing,
// please consult with me. Perhaps your ideas are better expressed as a project
// that employs Strata, instead of as a patch to Strata itself.
//
// ## Terminology
//
// We refer to the nodes in our b&#x2011;tree as ***pages***. The term node
// conjures an image of a discrete component in a linked data structure that
// contains one, maybe two or three, values. Nodes in a b&#x2011;tree contain
// hundreds or thousands of values. They are indexed. They are read from disk.
// They are allowed to fall out of memory when they have not been recently
// referenced. These are behaviors that people associate with a page of values.
//
// Otherwise, we use common terminology for ***height***, ***depth***,
// ***parent***, ***child***, ***split*** and ***merge***.
//
// There is no hard and fast definition for all the terms. A leaf is a fuzzy
// concept in b&#x2011;tree literature, for example. We call a page that
// contains records a ***leaf page***. We call a non-leaf page a ***branch
// page***. The term ***order*** means different things to different people.  We
// define the order of a branch page to be the maximum number of child pages,
// while the order of a leaf page to be the maximum number of records.
//
// We refer to the actual number of child pages in a branch page or the actual
// number of records in a leaf page as the page ***length***.
//
// The term ***b&#x2011;tree*** itself may not be correct. There are different
// names for b&#x2011;tree that reflect the variations of implementation, but
// those distinctions have blurred over the years. Our implementation may be
// considered a b+tree, since pages are linked, and records are stored only in
// the leaves.
//
// Terms specific to our implementation will be introduced as they are
// encountered in the document.
//
// ## Documentation Style
//
// This documentation is written to be read through, with no expecation that
// you, dear reader, will actually read it though. It is merely the style of the
// documentation. When you jump to read the documentation specific to
// a block of code, you're liable to read references to "the above", or be asked
// to "see below." The referenced passage should not be too far away, but you'll
// have go back or keep reading to find it.
//
// The documentation is not meant to be a handy reference to the interface, but
// instead an essay on logic behind the implementation. The alternative is to
// repeat descriptions of difficult concepts every time they are visited by the
// code. This is going to be painfully dull for the person who gives the code
// the time and attention necessary for a proper understanding.
//
// **TODO**: Remove this paragraph once you get used to the notion that people
// are probably going to mewl about not being able to understand the code, want
// an API reference, etc.
//
// ## What is a b&#x2011;tree?
//
// This documentation assumes that you understand the theory behind the
// b&#x2011;tree, and know the variations of implementation. If you are
// interested in learning about b&#x2011;trees you should start with the
// Wikipedia articles on [B-trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) and
// [B+trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree). I was introduced to
// b&#x2011;trees while reading [Algorithms in
// C](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201314525), quite some time ago.
//
// ## What flavor of b&#x2011;tree is this?
//
// Strata is a b&#x2011;tree with leaf pages that contain records ordered by the
// collation order of the tree. Records are stored for retrieval in constant
// time, addressed by an integer index so that they can be found using binary
// search.
//
// Branch pages contain links to other pages, and do not store records
// themselves.
//
// Leaf pages are linked in ascending order to simplify the implementation of
// traversal by cursors. Branch pages are singly linked in ascending order to
// simplify implementation of branch page merges.
//
// The order of a branch page is the maximum number of children for a branch
// page. The order of a leaf page is the maximum number of records for a leaf page.
// When a page exceeds its order it is split into two or more pages. When two
// sibling pages next to each other can be combined to create a page less than
// than the order, they are merged.
//
// The b&#x2011;tree always has a root branch page. The height of the tree
// increases when the root branch page is split. It decreases when the root
// branch page is merged. The split of the root branch is a different operation
// from the split of a non-root branch, because the root branch does not have
// siblings.

// Copy values from one hash into another.
function extend(to, from) {
  for (var key in from) to[key] = from[key];
  return to;
}

// Used to manipulate `argument` arrays.
var __slice = [].slice;

function say () {
    var args = __slice.call(arguments);
    console.log(require('util').inspect(args, false, null));
}

// ## Collation
//
// A b&#x2011;tree has a collation defined by the application developer.
//
// The collation is determined by the combination of an extractor and a
// comparator. The extractor is used to extract a key from the stored record.
// The comparator is used to order records by comparing the key.
//
// Separating extraction from comparison allows us to cache the key. We do not
// need the whole record for comparison, only the key. Keys are used to order
// the tree, so when we will constantly be reading records off the disk solely
// to get their key value.
//
// If a record is read for its key, but the record is not soon visited by a
// cursor, it will eventually be collected by a cache purge. If the key is
// frequently consulted by queries as they descend the tree, the key will be
// retained. If the key is subset of a large record, purging the records and
// retaining the keys will reduce the in&#x2011;memory size of the
// b&#x2011;tree.
//
// Also, the comparator is pretty easily generalized, while the extractor is
// invariably specialized. You might have a single string comparator that you
// use with extractors specialized for different types of records.
//
// ### Default Collation
//
// You will almost certainly define your own extractors and comparators, but the
// b&#x2011;tree has a default that works for a b&#x2011;tree that stores only
// JavaScript primitives.

// Default comparator for JavaScript primitives. You can use `a - b` for
// numbers. This works with both strings and numbers.
function compare (a, b) { return a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : 0 }

// Default extractor returns the value as whole for use as a key.
function extract (a) { return a }

// I began this project long ago, in 2010, as a first Node.js project, and as a
// first Node.js project, I experimented with the closure style of object
// construction. All of a `Strata` is a closure over the implementation. No
// prototypes. Instead, I build objects on the fly using `classify`.
//
// This `classify` function builds an object from a list of functions, assigning
// the functions as member functions, or else defining them as property getters
// or setters. If the function name starts with a `_`, then the name without the
// underscore is used as a property getter. If the function name ends with a
// `_`, then the property name is used as a property setter.
function classify () {
  var i, I, name;
  for (i = 0, I = arguments.length; i < I; i++) {
    name = arguments[i].name;
    if (name[0] == "_")
      this.__defineGetter__(name.slice(1), arguments[i]);
    else if (name[name.length - 1] == "_")
      this.__defineSetter__(name.slice(0, name.length - 1), arguments[i]);
    else
      this[arguments[i].name] = arguments[i];
  }
  return this;
}

// ## Pages
//
// Our b&#x2011;tree has two types of pages: leaf pages and branch pages.
//
// A ***leaf page*** contains records. A ***branch page*** contains references
// to other pages.
//
// Both leaf pages and branch pages are ordered according to the collation.
//
// To find a record, we descend a tree of branch pages to find the leaf page
// that contains the record. That is a b&#x2011;tree.
//
// ### Page I/O
//
// The `IO` class manages the reading and writing of leaf and branch pages to
// and from disk, page locking and page caching. It also implements the binary
// search we use to search the pages.

// ### Checksummed Lines of JSON

// Each page is stored in its own ***page file***. The page files are all kept
// in a single directory. The directory is specified by the application
// developer when the `Strata` object is constructed.
//
// Page files contain one or more JSON strings, one string per line. The JSON
// strings are checksummed. The checksum follows the JSON string on the line.
// The checksum is written as a hexadecimal number.
//
// The line based JSON format plays nice with traditional UNIX text utilities.
//
// A ***leaf page file*** acts as journal recording edit events. A JSON string
// is appended to the leaf page file to record a record insert or delete.
//
// A ***branch page file*** contains a single JSON object stored on a single
// line that contains the array of child page addresses.
//
// **TK**: Documentation damage. We're now calling a reference array a position
// array in a leaf page and an address array in a branch page. Do we want to
// consolidate to reference array? I'm beginning to think so. Many actions on
// this array are the same for both leaf pages and branch pages.
//
// When we read records and record keys off the disk, we store them in an object
// that acts as a cache for the page. The in-memory page object contains an
// array of integers that act as either page addresses or record positions. We
// call this the ***reference array***. The integers are stored in the reference
// array in the collation order of the stored records they reference.
//
// The in memory page object also contains a map of integer addresses to JSON
// objects. This is the ***record cache*** for the page object. The integers in
// the reference array are always present when the page is loaded, so that the
// integer array is dense, but the record cache only contains entries for
// records that have been referenced. We use a binary search to probe for keys
// and records, so we can avoid loading records we don't need.
//
// **TK**: Damage mentioned above ends here.
//
// We count on our JavaScript array implementation to be [clever about memory
// usage](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/614126/why-is-array-push-sometimes-faster-than-arrayn-value/614255\#614255).

// Set directory and extractor. Initialize the page cache and most-recently used
// list.
//
// The checksum will become CRC 32 by default in future releases and
// configurable to use any of the `crypto` module hashes or no checksum at all.

  // #### Verifying Checksums

  // When we read a line from a branch page file or a leaf page file, we always

  //
  // In our branch page files and leaf page files, we store one JSON string
  // per line. The checksum is written as a hexadecimal number following the
  // JSON string. We checksum the JSON string and compare it to the stored
  // checksum.
  //
  // A hyphen stored in place of the hexadecimal indicates no checksum.

  //

    ok(match, "corrupt line: cannot split line: " + line);

    return JSON.parse(match[1])
  }

  // Pages are identified by an integer page address. The page address is a
  // number that is incremented as new pages are created. A page file has a file
  // name that includes the page address.  When we load a page, we first derive
  // the file name from the page address, then we load the file.
  //
  // **TK**: Rewrite once we've finalized journaled balancing.
  //
  // The `filename` method accepts a suffix, so that we can create replacement
  // files. Instead of overwriting an existing page file, we create a
  // replacement with the suffix `.new`. We then delete the existing file with
  // the `delete` method and move the replacement into place with the `replace`
  // method. This two step write is part of our crash recovery strategy.
  //
  // We always write out entire branch page files. Leaf pages files are updated
  // by appending, but on occasion we rewrite them to vacuum deleted records.

  // Create a file name for a given address with an optional suffix.
  function filename (address, suffix) {
    suffix || (suffix = "");
    return path.join(directory, address + suffix)
  }

  // Move a replacement page file into place. Unlink the existing page file, if
  // it exists, then rename the replacement page file to the permanent name of
  // the page file.
  function replace (page, suffix, callback) {
    var replacement = filename(page.address, suffix)
      , permanent = filename(page.address)
      ;

    fs.stat(replacement, validator(callback)(stat));

    function stat (stat) {
      ok(stat.isFile(), 'is not a file');
      fs.unlink(permanent, unlinked);
    }

    function unlinked (error) {
      if (error && error.code != "ENOENT") callback(error);
      else fs.rename(replacement, permanent, callback);
    }
  }

  // Rename a page file from a page file with one suffix to another suffix.
  function rename (page, from, to, callback) {
    fs.rename(filename(page.address, from), filename(page.address, to), callback);
  }

  // Unlink a page file with the given suffix.
  function unlink (page, suffix, callback) {
    fs.unlink(filename(page.address, suffix), callback);
  }

  // ### Page Caching
  //
  // We keep an in&#x2011;memory map of page addresses to page objects. This is
  // our ***page cache***.
  //
  // #### Most-Recently Used List
  //
  // We also maintain a ***most-recently used list*** as a linked list using the
  // page objects as list nodes. When we reference a page, we unlink it from the
  // linked list and relink it at the head of the list. When we want to cull the
  // cache, we can remove the pages at the end of the linked list, since they
  // are the least recently used.
  //
  // #### Cache Entries
  //
  // Cache entries are the page objects themselves.
  //
  // It is important that the page objects are unique and that we do not represent
  // a page file with more than one page object, because the page objects house
  // the locking mechanisms. The page object acts as a mutex for page data.
  //
  // The cache entries are linked to form a doubly-linked list. The
  // doubly-linked list of cache entries has a head node that has a null
  // address, so that end-of-list traversal is unambiguous.
  //
  // We always move a page to the front of the core list when we reference it
  // during b&#x2011;tree descent.

  // Link tier to the head of the most-recently used list.
  function link (head, entry) {
    var next = head.next;
    entry.next = next;
    next.previous = entry;
    head.next = entry;
    entry.previous = head;
    return entry;
  }

  // Unlink a tier from the most-recently used list.
  function _unlink (entry) {
    var next = entry.next, previous = entry.previous;
    next.previous = previous;
    previous.next = next;
    return entry;
  }

  // #### Cache Purge Trigger
  //
  // There are a few ways we could schedule a cache purge: elapsed time; after a
  // certain number of requests; when a reference count reaches zero; or when
  // when a limit is reached.
  //
  // We take the limits approach. The bulk of a cached page is the size of the
  // references array and the size of objects in records map. We keep track of
  // those sizes. When we reach an application developer-specified maximum size
  // for cached records and page references for the entire b&#x2011;tree, we
  // trigger a cache purge to bring it below the maximum size. The purge will
  // remove entries from the end of the most-recently used list until the limit
  // is met.
  //
  // #### JSON Size
  //
  // There is no way to get the size of a JavaScript object in memory, so we
  // don't have a way to know the actual size of cached pages in memory.
  //
  // We can get a pretty good relative measure of the size of a page, however,
  // using the length of the JSON strings used to store records and references.
  //
  // The ***JSON size*** of a branch page is the string length of the address
  // array when serialized to JSON, plus the string length of each key loaded
  // into memory when serialized to JSON. The JSON size of leaf page is the
  // string length of the file position array when serialized to JSON, plus the
  // string length of each record loaded in memory when serialized to JSON.
  //
  // This is not an exact measure of the system memory committed to the in
  // memory representation of the b&#x2011;tree. It is a fuzzy measure of the
  // relative heft of page in memory. An exact measure is not necessary. We only
  // need to be sure to trigger a cache purge at some point before we reach the
  // hard limits imposed by system memory or the V8 JavaScript engine.
  //

  // Adjust the JSON size of the given page and the entire b&#x2011;tree.
  function heft (page, s) {
    page.size += s;
    size += s;
  }

  // #### Pages Held for Housekeeping
  //
  // There may be page objects loaded for housekeeping only. When balancing the
  // tree, the length of a page is needed to determine if the page needs to be
  // split, or if it can merged with a sibling page.
  //
  // We only need the order of the page to create our balance plan, however, not
  // the cached references and records. The page object keeps a copy of the
  // order in a `order` property. We can delete the page's reference array, as
  // well as the page's object cache. The page object the page entry itself
  // cannot be removed from the cache until it is no longer needed to calculate
  // a split or merge.
  //
  // We use reference counting to determine if an entry is participating in
  // balance calculations. If the page is being referenced by a balancer, we
  // purge the reference array and the cached records and keys, but we do not
  // unlink the page object from the most-recently used list nor remove it from
  // the cache.

  // ### Leaf Pages
  //
  // Five key things to know about leaf pages:
  //
  // * A leaf page is an array of records.
  // * A leaf page cannot contain two records that share the same key; therefore,
  // the b&#x2011;tree cannot contain duplicates.
  // * The key of the first record is the key for the leaf page; the keys of all
  // other records in the leaf page are always greater than the key for the leaf
  // page.
  // * If the first record is deleted, we keep a it as a ghost record, for the
  // sake of the key, until the leaf page can be vacuumed.
  // * The leaf page file is a text file of JSON strings that is an append log
  // of record insertions and deletions.
  //
  // #### Constant Time
  //
  // In the abstract, a leaf page is an array of records.  Given an integer, the
  // leaf page will return the record stored at the offset of the array. This
  // lookup is performed in constant time when the record is in memory.
  //
  // This lookup is performed in more or less constant time when the record is
  // uncached, so long you're willing to say that random access into a file is
  // constant time for our purposes. Otherwise, lookup is *O(log n)*, where *n*
  // is the number of file system blocks used to store the leaf page file.
  //
  // #### Binary Search
  //
  // Our leaf page implementation maintains an array of file positions called a
  // positions array. A file position in the positions array references a record
  // in the leaf page file by its file position. The positions in the positions
  // array are sorted according to the b&#x2011;tree collation of the referenced
  // records.
  //
  // In the leaf page file, a record is stored as a JSON string. Not all of the
  // records are loaded when the page loads. Records that are not loaded when
  // the page is loaded are loaded as needed. The leaf page keeps a map (a
  // JavaScript `Object`) that maps file positions to deserialized records.
  //
  // Because the records are sorted, and because a lookup takes constant time,
  // we can search for a record in a leaf page using binary search in
  // logarithmic time.
  //
  // #### No Duplicates
  //
  // Leaf pages cannot contain duplicate records. Therefore, the b&#x2011;tree
  // cannot contain duplicate records.
  //
  // You can simulate duplicate records by adding a series value to your key
  // which is stored in your record. The cursor implementation is designed to
  // facilitate ***pseudo-duplicate*** keys in this fashion.
  //
  // In theory, leaf pages can contain `null`, and `null` can be used as a key.
  // However, if you want to allow `null` keys in your b&#x2011;tree, you almost
  // certainly want to allow more than one `null` key, so you'll end up using
  // the pseudo-duplicate strategy for `null` keys as well.
  //
  // #### Ghosts and Leaf Page Length
  //
  // When we delete the first record of a leaf page, we keep the first record
  // around, because its key value is the key value for the leaf page. Changing
  // the key of a leaf page requires re-balancing the tree, so we need to wait
  // until we balance to vacuum the deleted first record.
  //
  // When we delete the first record we increment the `ghosts` property of the
  // page by `1`. The acutal length of a leaf page is the value `length` less
  // the value of the `ghosts` property. Only the first record is ever turned
  // into a ghost if deleted, so the value of the `ghosts` property is only
  // ever `0` or `1`.
  //
  // #### Leaf Page Split
  //
  // If the length of a leaf page exceeds the leaf page order, the leaf page is
  // split when the b&#x2011;tree is balanced.

  // The in-memory representation of the leaf page includes the address of the
  // leaf page, the page address of the next leaf page, and a cache that maps

  // records to the application developer. We're not strict about ownership, we
  // don't defensively copy the record before returning it or anything, so the
  // application developer may alter the record. When we uncache the record, we
  // won't be able to trust the recalculated JSON size. We keep a copy of the
  // size in an object in the leaf page cache.
  //

  // object at the time of caching.

  // ### Appends for Durability
  //
  // A leaf page file contains JSON objects, one object on each line. The
  // objects represent record insertions and deletions, so that the leaf page
  // file is essentially a log. Each time we write to the log, we open and close
  // the file, so that the operating system will flush our writes to disk. This
  // gives us durability.
  //
  // The caller determines which file should be written, so it opens and closes
  // the file descriptor. For record insertions and deletions, a file descriptor
  // is opened and closed for a single append. When rewriting an existing leaf
  // page in order to compact it, the file descriptor is kept open for the
  // multiple appends of the rewrite.
  //
  // The file descriptor must be open for append.

  // ### Leaf Page Journal
  //
  // The leaf page acts as an edit journal recording edit events. Each event is
  // stored as a ***journal entry***. These journal entries are appended to the
  // leaf page files as JSON arrays, one JSON array per line in the file.
  //
  // There are three types of journal entires recorded in a leaf page: ***insert
  // entires***, ***delete entries***, and ***position array entries***.
  //
  // The insert and delete entries record changes to the the leaf page.
  // Beginning with an empty position array and reading from the start of the
  // file, the leaf tier is reconstituted by replaying the inserts and deletes
  // described by the insert and delete entries.
  //
  // Position array entries record the state of the position array later on in
  // the history of the leaf page file, so that we don't have to replay the
  // entire history of the leaf page file in order to load the leaf page.
  //
  // #### Position Array
  //
  // Each leaf page has a ***position array***. The position array references
  // the position in the leaf page file where an insert entry records the
  // insertion of a record into the leaf page. When we want the record, if it is
  // not in memory, then we read it from the leaf page file at the given file
  // position.
  //
  // When the record has been read from the leaf page file, it is cached in the
  // `cache` object property of the in&#x2011;memory page object indexed by its
  // file position.
  //
  // When we write an insert entry, we take note of the insert entries file
  // position in the leaf page and use that position as its place holder in the
  // position array.
  //
  // The position array maintains the file positions of the inert entries in the
  // collation order of the b&#x2011;tree.
  //
  // #### Per-Entry Housekeeping
  //
  // Each entry include a count of entries in the leaf page. The count of
  // entries is always increasing by one. It is essentially a line number. We
  // can detect missing lines by detecting a break in the series. We perform
  // this check when loading a leaf page, to an extent. We can perform it
  // against the entire leaf page if we suspect corruption. **TIDY**
  //
  // Each insert or delete entry also includes the count of records in the leaf
  // page including the effects of the entry itself. The position array entry
  // includes the count of records implicitly, since it includes the position
  // array, which contains a position for each entry.
  //
  // **TODO** Including or prior to. I almost like prior to better. Almost
  // easier to document. No, prior to is easier to document, but then it becomes
  // inconsistent with entry number.
  //
  // #### Insert Entries
  //
  // We determine if an entry is an insert entry by examining the first element
  // in the entry JSON array.
  //
  // If the first element is an integer greater than zero, it indicates an
  // insert entry. The integer is the one based index into the zero based
  // position array, indicating the index where the position of the current
  // insert object should be inserted. The next two elements are the journal
  // housekeeping. The last element is of the insert entry is the record object.
  //
  // The JSON array elements form a structure as follows.
  //
  //  * Count of entries in leaf page including insert.
  //  * One-based index into position array.
  //  * Count of records in leaf page including insert.
  //  * Record to insert.
  //
  // When we read the insert entry, we will place the record in the record cache
  // for the page, mapping the position to the record.

  // Write an insert object.
  function writeInsert (fd, page, index, record, callback) {
    var entry = [ ++page.entries, index + 1, record ];
    writeJSON({ fd: fd, page: page, entry: entry }, callback);
  }

  // #### Delete Entries
  //
  // If the first element of our entry is less than zero, it indicates a delete
  // entry. The absolute value of the integer is the one based index into the
  // zero based position array, indicating the index of the position array
  // element that should be deleted.
  //
  // The next two elements are the journal housekeeping. The last element of
  // the insert entry is the record object.
  //
  // The JSON array elements of a delete entry form a structure as follows.
  //
  //  * Count of entries in leaf page including delete.
  //  * Negated one-based index into position array.
  //  * Count of records in leaf page including delete.
  //
  // Special handling of a deleted first record is required when we replay the
  // journal. The first record of a leaf page is not actually deleted from their
  // in-memory pages, but ghosted. We keep them around because the key of the
  // first record is the key for a page.
  //
  // There is no special accounting necessary to record the fact that the first
  // record is a ghost in the delete entry. We can see that it was the first
  // record that was deleted.
  //
  // There are no other elements in the JSON array for a delete entry, just the
  // negated one&#x2011;based index of the record to delete.

  // Write a delete object.

  // operating system, just like any system call. We need to check to see if
  // we've actually read or written the amount we expected, and continue with
  // the remainder if we haven't.

  // #### Position Array Entries
  //
  // A position array entry contains the position array itself. On occasion, we
  // store a copy of a constructed position array entry in the leaf page file so
  // that we can read a large leaf page file quickly.
  //
  // When we read a leaf page file, if we read from the back of the file toward
  // the front, we can read backward until we find a position array entry. Then
  // we can read forward to the end of the file, applying the inserts and
  // deletes that occurred after we wrote the position array entry.
  //
  // When a leaf page file is large, stashing the constructed position array at
  // the end means that the leaf page can be loaded quickly, because we will
  // only have to read backwards a few entries to find a mostly completed
  // position array. We can then read forward from the array to amend the
  // position array with the inserts and deletes that occurred after it was
  // written.
  //
  // Not all of the records will be loaded when we go backwards, but we have
  // their file position from the position array, so we can jump to them and
  // load them as we need them. That is, if we need them, because owing to
  // binary search, we might only need a few records out of a great many records
  // to find the record we're looking for.
  //
  // The position array entry includes some constant properties of the leaf
  // page.
  //
  // We write an array with a leaf page file format version number, indicating
  // the version of the leaf page file format, and therefore the version of
  // the entire b&#x2011;tree file format.
  //
  // We also include the address of the right sibling. This address will only
  // change when the leaf page file is rewritten.
  //
  // The JSON array elements of a delete entry form a structure as follows:
  //
  //  * Count of entries in leaf page including insert.
  //  * Zero to indicate a position array entry.
  //  * Leaf page file format version number.
  //  * Address of the right sibling leaf page.
  //  * Count of ghost records, only ever `0` or `1`.
  //  * The position array.
  //
  // The position array entry also acts as a header. We always place one at the
  // start of a leaf page, so that we can look at the head of the head of a leaf
  // page file to find its version and right sibling leaf page.
  //
  // **TK**: Counted b&#x2011;trees.

  // Write a position array entry.

  // ### Branch Pages
  //
  // Five key things to know about branch pages.
  //
  // * A branch page contains an array of addresses of child pages.
  // * The left most address is the left child of the entire branch page.
  // * The branch page keys are looked up as needed by descending the tree to
  // the left most leaf page of a child and using the leaf page key.
  // * The root branch page is always at address `0`.
  //
  // To find a record in the b&#x2011;tree, we first use a tree of branch pages
  // to find the leaf page that contains our record.
  //
  // A branch page contains the addresses of ***child pages***. This array of
  // page addresses is essentially an *array of children*.
  //
  // The child addresses are ordered according to the b&#x2011;tree collation of
  // the keys of the directly or indirectly referenced leaf pages.
  //
  // There are three types of branch pages, penultimate branch pages, interior
  // branch pages, and the root branch page.
  //
  // #### Penultimate Branch Pages
  //
  // A penultimate branch page is a branch page whose children are leaf pages.
  // If a branch page is not penultimate, then its children are branch pages.
  //
  // In a penultimate branch page, the array of children is ordered by the
  // b&#x2011;tree collation using a first record in the referenced leaf page
  // for ordering.  That is, the first record of the leaf page is used as the
  // key associated with a page address in a penultimate branch page.
  //
  // The non-leaf nodes of a b&#x2011;tree have the property that the number of
  // node children is one greater than the number of keys. We obtain this
  // property by treating the first child as the left child of the entire page,
  // and excluding its key from the search. We search the subsequent keys to
  // find the first key that is grater than or equal to the record sought. If we
  // encounter a key that is less than all the keys in the branch page, we know
  // that the record is contained in the leaf page child associated with the key
  // before it. We are able to perform this search using binary search in
  // logarithmic time.
  //
  // By ignoring the key of the first leaf page, the penultimate branch page has
  // a number of children that is one greater than the number of keys.
  //
  // **TK**: Not really explaining that it's only the left most leaf page that
  // is a special case. Suppose that I'm trying to introduce the concept.
  //
  // Notice that, when we are inserting a record into a leaf page other than the
  // left leaf page, we add it to a leaf page whose key is equal to or greater
  // than the penultimate branch key, so that the first record does not change,
  // and therefore that penultimate branch key does not change. The exception is
  // the left most leaf page, which accepts all the records less than the first
  // key, and therefore may accept a record less than its current least record.
  //
  // An insertion can only insert into the left most leaf page of a
  // penultimate branch page a record less than the least record of the leaf
  // page.
  //
  // #### Interior Branch Pages
  //
  // A branch page whose children are other branch pages is called an interior
  // branch page.
  //
  // Like the penultimate branch page, we treat the first child of an interior
  // branch page as the left child of the entire page. Like the penultimate
  // branch page the subsequent children have an associated key that is the
  // first record of a leaf page.
  //
  // The key is obtained by descending the sub&#x2011;tree referenced by the
  // child. We first visit the branch page referenced by the child. We then
  // visit left children recursively, visiting the left child of the child, and
  // the left child of any subsequently visited children, until we reach a leaf
  // page. The first record of that leaf page is the key to associate with the
  // child address in the address array of the interior branch page.
  //
  // It is the nature of the b&#x2011;tree that keys move up to the higher
  // levels of the tree as pages split, while preserving the collation order of
  // the keys. When a branch page splits, a key from the middle of the page is
  // chosen as a partition. The partition is used as the key for the right half
  // of the split page in the parent page.
  //
  // Our implementation does not store the keys, as you may have noticed, but
  // descends down to the leaf page to fetch the record to use as a key.
  //
  // We start from a penultimate page as a root page. When a leaf page fills, we
  // split it, creating a new right leaf page. The penultimate page uses the
  // first record of the new right page as the key to associate with that page.
  //
  // When the root penultimate page is full we split it, so that the root page
  // is an interior page with two children, which are two penultimate pages. The
  // tree now contains a root interior branch page, with a left penultimate
  // branch page and a right penultimate branch page.
  //
  // The root interior branch page has one key. Prior to split, that key was
  // associated with the address of a child leaf page. After split, the key is
  // associated with the right penultimate branch page. The leaf page is now the
  // left child of the right penultimate branch page.
  //
  // When we visit the root interior page, to obtain the key to associate with
  // the right penultimate page, we visit the right penultimate page, then we
  // visit its left child, the leaf page whose first record is the key.
  //
  // #### Root Branch Page
  //
  // The root page is the first page we consult to find the desired leaf page.
  // Our b&#x2011;tree always contains a root page. The b&#x2011;tree is never
  // so empty that the root page disappears. The root page always has the same
  // address.
  //
  // **TK**: move. Until the root branch page is split, it is both the root
  // branch page and a penultimate branch page.
  //
  // ### Keys and First Records
  //
  // We said that it is only possible for an insertion to insert into the left
  // most child leaf page of a penultimate branch page a record less than the
  // least record. We can say about a tree rooted by an interior branch page,
  // that an insertion is only able to insert into the left most leaf page in
  // the *entire tree* a record less than the least record.
  //
  // **TK**: Confusing.
  //
  // Using our example tree with one root interior page, with two penultimate
  // branch page children, we cannot insert a record into the right penultimate
  // branch page that will displace the first record of its left most child
  // branch, because that first record is the key for the right penultimate
  // branch page. When we insert a record that is less than the key, the search
  // for a leaf page to store the record goes to the left of the key. It cannot
  // descend into the right penultimate branch page, so it is impossible for it
  // be inserted into left child of the right penultimate branch page, so the
  // first record left child of the penultimate branch page will never be
  // displaced by an insertion.
  //
  // Only if we insert a record that is less than least key of the left
  // penultimate page do we face the possibility of displacing the first record
  // of a leaf page, and that leaf page is the left most leaf page in the entire
  // tree.
  //
  // This maintains a property of the b&#x2011;tree that for every leaf page
  // except the left most leaf page, there exists a unique branch page key
  // derived from the first record of the page.
  //
  // As above, you can find the first record used to derive a key by visting the
  // child and going left. You can find the leaf page to the left of the leaf
  // page used to derive a page branch key, by visiting the child to the left of
  // the key and going right.
  //
  // **NOTE**: Literate programming has finally materialized with Docco and
  // CoffeeScript.
  //
  // When the root page splits, it becomes an interior branch page. Until it
  // splits it is both the root page and a penultimate page.

  // ### Branch Page Files
  //
  // We create new branch pages in memory. They do not exist on disk until
  // they are first written.
  //
  // A new branch page is given the next unused page number.
  //
  // In memory, a branch page is an array of child page addresses. It keeps
  // track of its key and whether or not it is a penultimate branch page. The
  // cache is used to cache the keys associated with the child page addresses.
  // The cache maps the address of a child page to a key extracted from the
  // first record of the leaf page referenced by the child page address.
  //
  // Our in-memory branch page is also cached and added as a node an MRU list.
  // We must make sure that each page has only one in memory representation,
  // because the in memory page is used for locking.

  //
  function createBranch (override) {
    if (override.address == null) {
        while (nextAddress % 2) nextAddress++;

  // #### Branch Page JSON Size

  // The branch page JSON size is JSON string length of the address array, plus
  // the JSON string length of each cached key.
  //
  // ##### JSON Reference Array Size
  //
  // The `splice` method adds or remove references from the reference array
  // using the semantics similar to JavaScript's `Array.splice`. Similar, but
  // not identical. The replacement values are passed in as an array, not as
  // arguments at the end of a variable argument list.
  //
  // This wrapper for a basic array operation exists for the sake of the JSON
  // size adjustments, which would otherwise be scattered around the code. It is
  // the only place where the JSON string length of the reference array is
  // accounted for.

  //
  function splice (collection, page, offset, length, insert) {
    ok(typeof collection == 'string', 'incorrect collection passed to splice');

    var values = page[collection]
      , json
      , removals
      ;

    ok(values, 'incorrect collection passed to splice');

    // We remove first, then append. We used the array returned by `splice` to
    // generate a JSON substring, whose length we remove form the JSON size of
    // the page. We also decrement the page length.
    if (length) {
      removals = values.splice(offset, length);

      json = values.length == 0 ? "[" + removals.join(",") + "]"
                                : "," + removals.join(",");

      heft(page, -json.length);
    } else {
      removals = [];
    }

    // Insert references.
    if (insert != null) {
      // Convert a single argument into an array.
      if (! Array.isArray(insert)) insert = [ insert ];
      // First we generate a JSON substring from the insert array, whose length
      // we add to the JSON size of the page. We also increment the page length.
      if (insert.length) {
        json = values.length == 0 ? "[" + insert.join(",") + "]"
                                  : "," + insert.join(",");

        heft(page, json.length);

  // #### Opening
  //
  // Opening an existing database is a matter of checking for any evidence of a
  // hard shutdown. You never know. There may be a banged up leaf page file, one
  // whose last append did not complete. We won't know that until we open it.
  //
  // **TODO**: Ah, no. Let's revisit. Here's a simple strategy. Open touches a
  // file.  Closing deletes the file. If we open and the file exists, then we
  // probably have to inspect every file that was modified after the
  // modification, adjusting for dst? No because we'll be using seconds since
  // the epoch. Only if the system time is changed do we have a problem.
  //
  // Thus, we have a reference point. Any file after needs to be inspected. We
  // load it, and our `readLeaf` function will check for bad JSON, finding it
  // very quickly.
  //
  // Now, we might have been in the middle of a split. The presence of `*.new`
  // files would indicate that. We can probably delete the split. Hmm..
  //
  // We can add more to the suffix. `*.new.0`, or `*.commit`, which is the last
  // replacement. If we have a case where there is a file named `*.commit` that
  // does not have a corresponding permanent file, then we have a case where the
  // permanent file has been deleted and not linked, but all the others have
  // been, since this operation will go last, so we complete it to go forward.
  //
  // Otherwise, we delete the `*.commit`. We delete all the replacements that
  // are not commits.
  //
  // We can always do a thorough rebuild of some kind.
  //
  // Probably need "r" to not create the crash file, in case we're reading from
  // a read only file system, or something.

  // **TODO**: Close medic file.

  // ### Concurrency
  //
  // Although there is only a single thread in a Node.js process, the
  // b&#x2011;tree is still a concurrent data structure.
  //
  // When we navigate the tree from the root to search for a key in the tree, we
  // descend the b&x2011;. The act of descending the b&#x2011;tree is called a
  // ***descent***.
  //
  // A descent is a unit of work in our concurrency model. One descent of the
  // b&#x2011;tree can make progress while another descent of the tree is
  // waiting on evented I/O. Instead of thinking about concurrency in terms of
  // threads we talk about concurrent descents of the b&#x2011;tree.
  //
  // Descents of the b&#x2011;tree can become concurrent when descent encounters
  // a page that is not in memory. While it is waiting on evented I/O to load
  // the page files, the main thread of the process can make progress on another
  // request to search or alter the b&#x2011;tree, it can make process on
  // another descent.
  //
  // This concurrency keeps the CPU and I/O loaded.
  //
  // Note that the b&#x2011;tree must only be read and written by a single
  // Node.js process. You can't have two Node.js processes serving the same
  // database directory.
  //
  // ### Locking
  //
  // Every page has a read/write lock. Pages are obtained through the `IO.lock`
  // method, so that every time we obtain a page, it comes to us locked.
  //
  // Locking is internal and not exposed to the application developer. However,
  // the application developer must remember to close cursors, in order to
  // release the locks that cursors hold.
  //
  // #### Shared and Exclusive
  //
  // When we obtain a lock to read the page, we obtain a ***shared lock***. The
  // shared lock allows other descents to also obtain a lock on the page. With a
  // shared lock, you can read the page, knowing that it will not change.
  //
  // When we obtain a lock to write the page, we obtain an ***exclusive lock***.
  // The exclusive lock prevents all other descents from obtaining any sort of
  // lock on the page. No other page will be able to obtain neither a shared nor
  // an exclusive lock.
  //
  // #### Locking Sub-Trees
  //
  // When we descend the tree, moving from parent page to child page, we obtain
  // locks in descending order. This means that if we obtain an exclusive lock
  // on a page, no other descent will be able to travel from the parent of that
  // page, to the children of that page. It effectively blocks new descents from
  // entering the ***sub&#x2011;tree*** that is defined by the exclusively
  // locked page and all its children.
  //
  // #### Rationale for Locking
  //
  // Locking prevents race conditions where a descent that is waiting on an
  // evented I/O request returns to find that the structure of the b&#x2011;tree
  // has changed drastically. For example, while a descent was waiting for a
  // leaf page to load into memory, another descent might load the same page
  // into memory, merge the leaf page with its sibling, and delete it.
  //
  // #### Caching
  //
  // Locks prevent cache purges. When a cache purge is triggered, a page with
  // outstanding locks will not be purged from the cache.
  //
  // #### Lock Properties
  //
  // The locking mechanism is a writer-preferred shared read, exclusive write
  // lock. If a descent holds an exclusive write lock, then all lock requests by
  // other descents are blocked. If one or more descents hold a shared read
  // lock, then any request for an exclusive write lock is blocked. Any request
  // for a shared read lock is granted, unless an exclusive write lock is
  // queued.
  //
  // The locks are not re-entrant.

  // &mdash;
  function lock (address, exclusive, callback) {
    // We must make sure that we have one and only one page object to represent
    // the page. The page object will maintain the lock queue for the page. It
    // won't do to have different descents consulting different lock queues.
    // There can be only one.
    //
    // The queue is implemented using an array of arrays. Shared locks are
    // grouped inside one of the arrays in the queue element. Exclusive locks
    // are queued alone as a single element in the array in the queue element.
    var page, creator, locks;

    //
    if (page = cache[address]) {
      // Move the page to the head of the most-recently used list.
      link(mru, _unlink(page));
    //
    } else {
      // Create a page to load with an empty `load` queue. The presence of the
      // `load` queue indicates that the page needs to be read from file.
      page = encache(constructors[address % 2 ? "leaf" : "branch"]({ address: address, load: [] }));
    }

    // #### Lock Implementation
    //
    // We don't use mutexes, of course, because Node.js doesn't have the concept
    // of mutexes to protect critical sections of code the way that threaded
    // programming platforms do.
    //
    // Nor do we use file system locking.
    //
    // Instead, we simulate locks using callbacks. A call to `lock` is an
    // evented function call that provides a callback. If the `lock` method can
    // grant the lock request to the caller, the lock method will invoke the
    // callback.
    //
    // If the `lock` method cannot grant the lock request, the `lock` method
    // will queue the callback into a queue of callbacks associated with the
    // page. When other descents release the locks that prevent the lock
    // request, the lock request callback is dequeued, and the callback invoked.

  // ## Descent
  //
  // We use the term *descent* to describe b&#x2011;tree operations, because all
  // b&#x2011;tree operations require a descent of the b&#x2011;tree, a
  // traversal of the b&#x2011;tree starting from the root. Whenever we are
  // search the tree, insert or delete records, or balance the tree with page
  // splits and merges, we first begin with a descent of the b&#x2011;tree, from
  // the root, to find the page we want to act upon.
  //
  // #### Descent as Unit of Work
  //
  // We use the term descent to describe both the traversal of the b&#x2011;tree
  // and the subsequent actions performed when when the desired page is found.
  //
  // The descent is the unit of work in our concurrency model.  A descent is
  // analogous to a thread, because when a descent waits on I/O, other descents
  // can make progress.
  //
  // Descents can make progress concurrently, even though Node.js only has a
  // single thread of execution. Descents do not actually make progress in
  // parallel, but their progress can be interleaved. When we descend the tree,
  // we may have to wait for evented I/O to read or write a page. While we wait,
  // we can make progress on another descent in the main thread of execution.
  //
  // Because descents can make interleaved progress, we need to synchronize
  // access to b&#x2011;tree pages, just as we would with a multi-threaded
  // b&#x2011;tree implementation.  When we descend the b&#x2011;tree we need to
  // make sure that we do not alter pages that another waiting descent needs to
  // complete its descent when it awakes, nor read pages that a waiting descent
  // had begun to alter before it had to wait.
  //
  // These are race conditions. We use the shared read/exclusive write locks
  // described in the `IO` class above to guard against these race conditions.
  //
  // #### Classes of Descent
  //
  // When we descend to leaf pages of a b&#x2011;tree to obtain records,
  // we *search* the b&#x2011;tree. When we change the size of the b&#x2011;tree
  // by adding or deleting records we *edit* the b&#x2011;tree. When we change
  // the structure of the b&#x2011;tree by splitting or merging pages, we
  // *balance* the b&#x2011;tree.
  //
  // We talk about search descents, edit descents, and balance descents when we
  // describe the interaction of b&#x2011;tree operations.
  //
  // We use these terms in this document to save the chore of writing, and the
  // confusion of reading; insert or delete, or split or merge. We also want to
  // draw a distinction between changing the count of records stored in the
  // b&#x2011;tree, *editing*, and changing the height of the b&#x2011;tree, the
  // count of pages, or the choice of keys, *balancing*.
  //
  // #### Locking on Descent
  //
  // Because a search descent does not alter the structure of the b&#x2011;tree,
  // multiple search descents can be performed concurrently, without interfering
  // with each other.
  //
  // Descents that alter the b&#x2011;tree require exclusive access, but only to
  // the pages they alter. A search descent can still make progress in the
  // presence of an alteration decent, so long as the search does not visit the
  // pages being altered.
  //
  // A search descent obtains shared locks on the pages that it visits.  An
  // alteration descent obtains exclusive locks only on the pages that it needs
  // to alter. The alteration descent will obtain shared locks on the pages that
  // visits in search the pages that it wants to alter.
  //
  // #### Locking Hand Over Hand
  //
  // To allow progress in parallel, we lock only the pages we need to descend
  // the tree, for only as long as we takes to determine which page to visit
  // next. Metaphorically, we descend the tree locking hand-over-hand.
  //
  // We start from the root page. We lock the root page. We perform a binary
  // search that compares our search key against the keys in the root page. We
  // determine the correct child page to visit to continue our search. We lock
  // the child page. We then release the lock on the parent page.
  //
  // We repeat the process of locking a page, searching it, locking a child, and
  // then releasing the lock on the child's parent.
  //
  // We hold the lock on the parent page while we acquire the lock on the child
  // page because we don't want another descent to alter the parent page,
  // invaliding the direction of our descent.
  //
  // #### Lateral Traversal of Leaf Pages
  //
  // Leaf pages are singly linked to their right sibling. If you hold a lock on
  // a leaf page, you are allowed to obtain a lock on its right sibling. This
  // left right ordering allows us to traverse the leaf level of the
  // b&#x2011;tree, which simplifies the implementation of record cursors and
  // page merges.
  //
  // When we move from a leaf page to its right sibling, we hold the lock on the
  // left leaf page until we've obtained the lock on the right sibling. The
  // prevents another descent from relinking our page and invalidating our
  // traversal.
  //
  // #### Deadlock Prevention and Traversal Direction
  //
  // To prevent deadlock between search and mutate descents and balancing
  // descents, when descending the b&#x2011;tree for search or mutation we
  // always traverse a parent branch page to its child. When traversing leaf
  // pages, we always traverse from left to right. By traversing in a consistent
  // order we prevent the deadlock that would occur when another descent was
  // attempting to obtain locks on pages in the opposite order.
  //
  // Because there is only ever one balance descent at a time, and because
  // branch pages are only ever locked exclusively by balance descents, we are
  // allowed to take more liberties when traversing branch pages for the purpose
  // of balancing. We can lock the right sibling of a branch page before locking
  // the branch page because we know that we're the only descent that would move
  // laterally along branch page levels of the b&#x2011;tree.
  //
  // Balance descents can also begin a shared or exclusive descent at any branch
  // page or leaf page in the b&#x2011;tree, so long as they do not already have
  // a branch locked. Because only a balance descents will change the shape of
  // the b&#x2011;tree, it can start anywhere in b&#x2011;tree. A search or
  // mutation descent cannot jump to any page in the b&#x2011;tree because it
  // risks jumping to a page that is the process of being split or merged.
  //
  // As an extra special case, if a balance descent is only performing shared
  // locks in a descent that only includes branch pages, it can lock however
  // many branch pages it likes, in any order. In this case, there are no other
  // descents that would perform an exclusive lock on any branch page, so their
  // is no chance of deadlock. As an added bonus, for this special case, the
  // shared lock implementation is reentrant, so the balance descent can lock a
  // branch page in any order as many times as it likes.

  //

    // #### Forking
    //
    // We use `fork` to create a new descent using the position of the current
    // descent. The new descent will continue to descend the tree, but without
    // releasing the lock on the page held by the descent from which we forked.
    //
    // When we split and merge pages other than the root page, we need to hold
    // locks on pages at more than one level of the tree. Pages at the parent
    // level will have nodes inserted or deleted. Pages at the child level will
    // be split or merged. When we reach a parent, we use `fork` to create a new
    // descent, so we don't release our lock on the parent when we visit the
    // child.
    //
    // When we merge and delete leaf pages, we also need to update the key,
    // which may be at any level of the tree. We need to hold our lock on the
    // branch page that contains the key, while still descending the tree to
    // find the two pages that need to be merged. The two pages to merge may not
    // be immediate children of the same penultimate branch page.
    //
    // **TK** Glurgh: We need to leave the key page locked, then go left and
    // right to find two separate pages. We do not need to hold locks on all the
    // pages down to the targets, just the pivot point and the targets  The
    // hand-over-hand logic works fine. Descending hand-over-hand exclusive will
    // cause us to wait for other descents to finish, squeezing the other
    // descents out.

    // We create a new `Descent` which creates a dummy first page. We then
    // assign the addresses current descent to the dummy page, and copy the
    // current index.

    //

  // ## Cursors
  //
  // Application developers navigate the b&#x2011;tree using one of two types of
  // ***cursor***. To read records in the b&x2011;tree they use an
  // ***iterator***. To read records, as well as insert and delete records, they
  // use ***mutator***.
  //
  // An iterator provides random access to the records in a page. It can move
  // from a page to the right sibling of the page. A mutator does the same, but
  // it is also able to insert or delete records into the current page.
  //
  // ### Iterator
  //
  // The application developer uses an iterator to move across the leaf pages of
  // the b&#x2011;tree in ascending collation order, one leaf page a time.
  //
  // #### Search Keys
  //
  // The application developer obtains an iterator by calling `Strata.iterator`
  // with a ***search key***.  The search key is used to find the leaf page
  // where the record from which the key is derived belongs in the
  // b&#x2011;tree. The record may not actually exist in the b&#x2011;tree, in
  // which case the iterator begins with the leaf page where record *would* be.
  //
  // #### Page by Page
  //
  // The leaf pages themselves are visited one at a time, not the records. The
  // iterator can randomly access any record in the currently visited leaf page.
  //
  // When a page is visited it is read locked, so that other descents can visit
  // the page, but they cannot insert or delete records. By locking the pages
  // left to right hand over hand, then there is no way for the tree to mutate
  // such that would defeat our iteration. Leaf pages that we've visited may by
  // edited by another descent after we've visited them, however.
  //
  // **TK**: Definition of keys and records. Go back up and make sure one is
  // there.
  //
  // #### Record Ranges
  //
  // The cursor will define an `offset` property and a `length` property. The
  // `offset` is positioned at the first record in the page whose key is equal
  // to or greater than the search key. The `length` is the count of records in
  // the page. This defines the range of records whose key is greater than or
  // equal to the search key.
  //
  // On the first page visited, the key of the record at the `index` is greater
  // than or equal to the search key. Every key of every record that follows the
  // record at the index is greater than the search key.
  //
  // #### Full Tree Iteration
  //
  // The application developer can also obtain an iterator that begins at the
  // left most leaf page by calling `Strata.iterator` without a search key. This
  // positions the iterator at the first leaf page in the b&#x2011;tree and the
  // index at the first record in b&#x2011;tree.
  //
  // #### Double Loop
  //
  // The interface to iteration requires the application developer to implement
  // double loop to traverse the leaf pages. The outer loop moves from page to
  // page. The inner loop moves from record to record. The iterator interface
  // does not hide the underlying structure of the leaf pages.
  //
  // It is not intended to be an abstraction. It is intended to expose the
  // structure. Do not confuse the iterator with an iterator from other APIs
  // that exposes one item at a time. Our iterator exposes a range of records.
  //
  // #### Ranged Searches
  //
  // Ranged searches are performed by searching for the start of the range and
  // iterating to the end of the range. There is nothing to this. It is how
  // iterator is implemented.
  //
  // We may be interested in searching for time series data that occurred
  // between noon and midnight, where are time stamp is POSIX time, milliseconds
  // since the epoch.  We create an iterator with a search key that is noon
  // according to POSIX time. It doesn't matter to us if there were no events
  // that occurred exactly at the millisecond that defines noon. Our iterator
  // begins at the point that is either an event that occurred millisecond that
  // defines noon, or else the first event that occurred after the noon
  // millisecond.
  //
  // When we encounter to the first event that occurs after midnight, we ignore
  // that event and terminate traversal. We've successfully found all the events
  // in our range.

  //

    // ### Mutator

    // A mutator is an iterator that can also edit leaf pages. It can delete
    // records from the currently visit leaf page. It can insert records into
    // the current leaf page, if the record belongs in the current leaf page.
    //
    // As with `Iterator`, it moves across the leaf pages of the b&#x2011;tree
    // in ascending collation order. It has random access to the records in the
    // page using an index into the array of records.
    //
    // As with `Iterator`, the application developer obtains an iterator by
    // calling `Strata.mutator` with a search key.
    //
    // #### Ranged Inserts
    //
    // You can insert a range of records using a single mutator. This is
    // efficient if you have a range of records whose keys are close together,
    // maybe so close that they are all on the same page, so you can descend the
    // tree to the correct page and insert them in one fell swoop.
    //
    // #### Ambiguous Insert Locations
    //
    // Insert locations for ranged inserts can be ambiguous if the binary search
    // indicates that a record should be inserted at the end of the leaf page,
    // after the current last record in the leaf page. If the insert location is
    // after the last record, it could be the case that the record really
    // belongs to a right sibling leaf page.
    //
    // This is only a problem when we insert a record whose key is not the key
    // used to create the mutator. An insert location is always unambiguous if
    // the key is the search key used to locate the first page. The key is
    // determined to belong inside the leaf page by virtue of a descent of the
    // b&#x2011;tree. That is unambiguous.
    //
    // To know if a subsequent record insert really does belong after the last
    // record but before the first record of the right sibling leaf page, we
    // have to load the right sibling leaf page and peek at the record. When we
    // do this, we need to keep the right sibling leaf page locked, so that the
    // key of the right sibling page cannot change.
    //
    // This peek has a cost. If you are inserting a range, and the records are
    // more often pages apart from each other than they are on the same page, it
    // might not be worth it to peek. It might be more efficient to assume that
    // the next record is much further along and create a new mutator for the
    // remainder of the insert range. In this case we're saying, see if you can
    // insert the next record on this page as long as we're here, but we leaf
    // traversal is inefficient for our range,  so don't try too hard.
    //
    // If we are only inserting a single record, there's no ambiguity, because
    // we'll use the key of the record to create the mutator. There is no need
    // to enable peek for a single insert, but there is no real cost either.
    //
    // #### Duplicate Keys
    //
    // Although duplicate keys are not allowed, abstracted duplicate keys are
    // not difficult for the application developer to implement. One simply adds
    // a hidden series value to the key. This creates a series of records in the
    // leaf pages that have an identical user key disambiguated by the series
    // value.
    //
    // Given a key plus a maximum series value, you will always land after the
    // last one the series, or else a record that is less than the key, which
    // means that the series is zero.
    //
    // The maximum series value is a module developer choice, so chose a
    // `Number`. That way you can search using `Number.MAX_VALUE` as the series
    // value and you will always land at the spot where a new record should be
    // appended. The correct series value to store is the series value of the
    // record at the given insert index plus one if the key is identical, zero
    // if it is not.
    //
    // **TODO**: Zero is a valid index for the left most leaf page.
    //
    // #### Insert

    // As noted elsewhere, you will provide an insert index, but you will
    // provide one that you've obtained from either the `Cursor` or through a
    // call to `indexOf`. Get the correct index, then toddle over to `insert`
    // and give `insert` the correct index.
    //
    // Why is this index not encapsulated? Because the descent will have
    // performed a binary search on the leaf, stored the result in the `index`
    // property of the cursor, and we don't want to repeat that binary search
    // because we're stingy.
    //
    // At some point, you're going to want come back and reconsider
    // encapsulation. Please, don't. Before long, we're going to want to expose
    // more the properties of the b&#x2011;tree, not hide them. Encapsulation is
    // not your friend. It makes you look at this data structure as a black box,
    // and it is not a black box.

    //  &mdash;

    // Insert the record with the given key at the given index. Obtain the
    // correct index to preserve the sort order by calling `indexOf`.
    //
    // If the index is after the last record in the leaf page, this method will
    // check that the record does not actually belong in a subsequent sibling
    // leaf page.
    //
    // If the insert index of the record is `0` and this is not the first leaf
    // page of the tree, `insert` will return `-1` indicating that the record
    // belongs in a leaf page to the left of the current leaf page. This is
    // unambiguous, but it will always require that you descend the tree to find
    // the correct leaf leaf page for insert.
    //
    // If there is a right sibling leaf page, it will load the right sibling
    // leaf page and check that the leaf is less than the key of the right
    // sibling leaf page. If the key of the insert record is greater than the
    // key of the right sibling leaf page, then the record does not belong in
    // this leaf page. The record will not be inserted. The method returns `1`
    // indicating that the record belongs in a leaf page to the right of the
    // current leaf page. Because the right leaf page key is cached, the right
    // leaf page key may change, so the `+1` result is probably correct,
    // possibly incorrect, but the correct course of action it to descend the
    // tree again which is always correct and resolves the ambiguity.
    //
    // If the insert index of the record is after the last record, and upon
    // peeking at the first record of the right sibling leaf page we determine
    // that the record belongs on a subsequent page, `insert` will return
    // `false` indicating that the record does not belong in the current leaf
    // page.
    //
    // This method will happily accept all other forms of invalid data. The
    // application developer is responsible for maintaining the collation order
    // of the leaf page. The application developer must not insert duplicates.
    // The application developer must make sure to provide a `record`, `key` and
    // `index` that correspond to each other. No assertions are performed on the
    // validity of the insert.
    //
    // #### Avoiding the Peek
    //
    // There is a cost involved with peeking at the right sibling leaf page to
    // determine if a record greater than the greatest record in the current
    // leaf page belongs in the current page, or in a subsequent leaf page. If
    // the application developer doesn't want to peek, they can take matters
    // into their own hands. They can determine the insert location using
    // `indexOf`, and if it is after the last record, they can use a new mutator
    // to find the insert location of the next page.
    //
    // There is no cost involved when inserting a range into the last leaf page,
    // a common operation, because the right sibling leaf page does not exist,
    // so there is no doubt that the records belong on the last page.

    //
    function insert (record, key, index, callback) {
      var check = validator(callback), unambiguous;

      // On every leaf page except the first leaf page of the descent (not of
      // the entire tree), the least record is the key, and inserted records are
      // always greater than the key. Thus, if we have an index of zero and we
      // are not the first leaf page, the record does not belong in this leaf

  // #### Insertion and Deletion Versus Balance
  //
  // We do not attempt to balance the tree with every insertion or deletion. The
  // client may obtain a cursor to the leaf pages, iterate through them deleting
  // records along the way. As the client alters leaf records, they are marked
  // as candidates for balance. Balancing will take place periodically, where a
  // single thread of control **TK** will
  //
  // #### Staccato Balance Operations
  //
  // The b&#x2011;tree balance operations cascade by nature. If you insert a
  // value into a leaf node, such that the leaf node is beyond capacity, you
  // split the leaf node, adding a new child to the parent node. If the parent
  // node is now beyond capacity, you split the parent node, adding a new child
  // to its parent node. When every node on the path to the leaf node is at
  // capacity, a split of the leaf node will split every node all they way up to
  // the root.
  //
  // Merges too move from leaves to root, so that a merge at one level of the
  // b&#x2011;tree potentially triggers a merge of the parent with one of its
  // siblings.
  //
  // However, we've established rules for lock acquisition that require that
  // locks are obtained from the top down, and never from the bottom up. This is
  // why we do not perform balance operations as a part of a single pass. We
  // instead descend the tree once to insert or delete records form the leaf
  // pages. We then descend the tree once for each split or merge of a page.
  //
  // Much b&#x2011;tree literature makes mention of a potential efficiency where
  // you split full pages on the way back up from an insert. You can determine
  // which pages would split if the leaf split as you descend the b&#x2011;tree,
  // since you'll visit every page that would participate in a split.
  //
  // That efficiency applies only for split, and not for merge, because you have
  // to inspect the left and right siblings of a page to determine if it is time
  // to merge. If the left sibling page of a page, is not also child of that
  // page's parent page, then the left sibling page is in a different
  // sub&#x2011;tree. It can not be reached by the path that was used to find
  // the leaf page where the delete occurred.
  //
  // The single pass insert on the way down and split on the way up violates the
  // rules we laid out to prevent deadlock. To abide by our rules, we'd have to
  // lock exclusively on the way down, then hold the locks on the pages above
  // the leaf page that were full and could possibly split. This would reduce
  // the liveliness of our implementation.
  //
  // There are compromises, but rather than create a complicated locking
  // apparatus, with upgrades, we're going to simplify our algorithm greatly, by
  // descending the tree once for each split or merge.
  //
  // When we travel to the unbalanced page, we acquire shared locks in the hand
  // over hand fashion used for search. We acquire exclusive locks only on those
  // pages that participate in the balance operation. That is two pages in the
  // case of the split. In the case of a merge that is three pages. During a
  // balance operation are locking exclusively, at most, three pages at a time.
  //
  // If out balance operation cascades so that it requires a balance at every
  // level, we'll descend the tree once for every level. However, the path we
  // follow is almost certain to be in memory, since we're revisiting the same
  // path.
  //
  // Also, a balance operation will involve an increasing number of levels with
  // decreasing frequency. A split will most often require that only the leaf
  // page is split. The penultimate pages will be involved in a balance
  // operation at least an order of magnitude less frequently. The pages above
  // the penultimate branch pages will be involved in a balance operation yet
  // another order of magnitude less frequently.
  //
  // Conserving descents during balance operations is a false economy. It
  // complicates lock acquisition. It reduces the liveliness of the
  // b&#x2011;tree.
  //
  // The multiple descents will allow searches of the b&#x2011;tree to make
  // progress between balance operations.
  //
  // ##### Descent as Unit of Work
  //
  // We can see that a descent of the tree is analogous to a thread in
  // multi-threaded operation. A decent is an actor on the tree, performing a
  // single balance operation, searching
  //
  // ##### Delayed Balance
  //
  // We've determined that we do not want to perform a split or merge of the
  // leaf level the moment we've detected the need for one. If we fill a leaf
  // page, we descend the tree again to split the leaf page.
  //
  // Because the b&#x2011;tree is a concurrent structure, the leaf split descent
  // may discover that another descent has removed a record, and a leaf split is
  // no longer necessary. There may be, in fact, a descent on the way to the
  // left sibling of the page, to check for the potential for a merge.
  //
  // The concurrent operation means that we have to deal with situation where
  // we've undertaken a descent to balance the b&#x2011;tree, but another series
  // of descents has rendered that plan invalid.
  //
  // As long as we're dealing with that problem, we may as well decouple
  // insertion and deletion form split and merge entirely, and see if we can't
  // gain more liveliness, and a simpler implementation, by separating these
  // concerns.
  //
  // We can provide an interface where the application developer can insert or
  // delete any number of records, then order a balance of the tree that takes
  // all the changes into account. This can avoid degenerate cases of sort where
  // a leaf page at the split threshold and the application in turn inserts and
  // deletes a single record from it.
  //
  // We can provide the application developer with a cursor. The cursor can
  // delete a range of values, or insert a range of values, without having to
  // descend the tree for each inserted value. The developer can insert or
  // delete records as fast as the operating system can append a string to a
  // file. We'll balance this mess for her later.
  //
  // It is still cheap to check for balance for single inserts or deletes, as if
  // we were checking as part of a single pass.
  //
  // ##### Balance Thread
  //
  // We perform balance operations one a time. We do not begin a new balance
  // operation until the previous one completes. In essence, we perform
  // balancing in a separate thread of execution.
  //
  // Of course, a Node.js application really only has one thread of execution.
  // In our b&#x2011;tree, however, multiple descents can make progress at the
  // time, or rather, the progress made by one decent, while another descent
  // waits on I/O.
  //
  // We ensure that only one descent at a time is making progress toward the
  // balance of the tree. This simplifies or balance implementation, because the
  // structure of the tree, its depth and number of pages, will only be changed
  // one one series of descents. A balance descent can assume that the tree
  // retain its structure while the balance descent waits on I/O.
  //
  // ##### Balancer
  //
  // We will call the code that co-ordinates the series of splits and merges to
  // balance the tree, the *balancer*.
  //
  // The balancer maintains an offset count for each modified leaf page in the
  // b&#x2011;tree. When an insert is performed, the offset count for the leaf
  // page is incremented.  When a delete is performed, the offset count for the
  // leaf page is decremented. This keeps track of the total change in size.
  //
  // We use the offset counts to determine which pages changed.
  //
  // ##### Balance Cutoff
  //
  // When it comes time to balance, we create a new balancer and put it in place
  // to collect a new round of offset counts, while we are off balancing the
  // pages gathered in the last round balance counts.
  //
  // We create a balance plan for the current set of pages. We balance the tree,
  // splitting and merging pages according to our balance plan. Only one
  // balancer balances the tree at a time. The balancer perform one split or
  // merge descent at a time. Balance descents are never concurrent with other
  // balance descents.
  //
  // While balancing takes place, records can be inserted and deleted
  // concurrently. Those changes will be reflected when the next balancer
  // balances the tree.
  //
  // ##### Creating a Balance Plan
  //
  // When it comes time to balance, we consult the pages for which we've
  // maintained the offset counts. If the page is greater than the maximum page
  // size, we split the page. That much is obvious. Otherwise, if the offset
  // count is negative, we've deleted records. There may be an opportunity to
  // merge, so we check the left and right siblings of the page to determine if
  // a merge is possible.
  //
  // Determining a plan for a merge requires inspecting three pages, the page
  // that decreased in size, plus its left and right sibling pages. We merge a
  // page with the sibling that will create the smallest page that is less than
  // or equal to the maximum page size.
  //
  // ##### Purging the Cache
  //
  // When inspecting page for merge, we are only interested in the count of
  // records in the page. It may have been a long time since the last merge, so
  // we might have accumulated a lot of pages that need to be consulted. To
  // create a complete plan, we'll need to gather up the sizes of all the leaf
  // pages, and the only way to get the size of a page is to load it into
  // memory. But, we won't need to keep the page in memory, because we only need
  // the size.
  //
  // When we calculate a merge, we load the left and right sibling. We're
  // touching a lot of pages that we don't really know that we need.
  //
  // When we lock a page, we indicate that if the page is loaded, it ought to be
  // loaded into balancer most-recently used list. This indicates that the page
  // was loaded by the balancer. We also set the balancer flag, indicating that
  // we need to preserve the page for record count, even if the actual page data
  // is discarded by a cache purge.
  //
  // We check the cache size frequently. If we're going over, we offer up the
  // balancer pages to the cache purge first. If we determine that a page will
  // be used in a balance operation we add it to the core most-recently used
  // list, where it is subject to the same priority as any other page loaded by
  // the cache.
  //
  // ### Splitting
  //
  // Splitting is the simpler of the two balancing operations.
  //
  // To split a leaf page, we start by obtaining the key value of the first
  // record. We can do this by acquiring a read lock on the page, without
  // performing a descent. The balancer gets to break some rules since it knows
  // that we know that the b&#x2011;tree is not being otherwise balanced.
  //
  // We descend the tree until we encounter the penultimate branch page that is
  // the parent of the branch page.  We acquire an exclusive lock the branch
  // page. We can release our shared lock and acquire an exclusive lock. We do
  // not have retest conditions after the upgrade, because only the balancer
  // would change the keys in a branch page, and we're the balancer.
  //
  // We allocate a new leaf page. We append the greater half of the record to
  // the page. We add the page as a child to the penultimate branch page to the
  // right of the page we've split. We unlock the pages.
  //
  // We can see immediately if the penultimate page needs to be split. If it
  // does, we descend the tree with the same key, stopping at the parent of the
  // penultimate page. We will have kept the address of the parent of the
  // penultimate page for this reason. We split the penultimate page, copying
  // the addresses to a new right sibling. Adding the right sibling to the
  // parent. We make sure to clear the cache of keys for the addresses we are
  // removing. (Oh, and clear the cache for the records when you leaf split. Oh,
  // hey, copy the records as well, duh.)
  //
  // Note that a page split means a change in size downward. It means that one
  // or both of our two halves may be a candidate to merge with what were the
  // left and right siblings of the page before it split. There may have been
  // less than half a page of records one or both both of the sides of the tree.
  // After we split, we check for a chance to merge. More live lock fears, but
  // one heck of a balanced tree.
  //
  // ### Need to Add
  //
  // We always balance cascading up. Unlike leaf pages, which we can allow to
  // deplete, the branch pages cannot be allowed to become empty as we merge
  // leaf pages. As we delete records, we still keep a ghost of a key. As we
  // delete leaf pages, we delete the ghost keys. Branch pages become paths to
  // nowhere. They don't hold their own keys, so they can't find them.  We'd
  // have to have null keys in our tree. Even if we kept keys around, we're
  // sending searches down a path to nowhere. There is no leaf page to visit. We
  // get rid of these paths. We always balance the upper levels immediately, we
  // perform the cascade. Our tree descent logic would have to account for these
  // empty sub&#x2011;trees. Much better to balance and keep things orderly.
  //
  // This raises a concerns about live lock, that we might be balancing
  //
  // **TK**: Yes file times are enough. Even if the system clock changes
  // drastically, the file times are all relative to one another. It it changes
  // during operation, that is a problem, but we're not going to endeavor to
  // provide a solution that deals with erratic clock times. Worst case, how do
  // we not detect a file in need of recovery? We ignore files older than the
  // time stamp file. So, we might have the system clock move far backward, so
  // that the time stamp file is much newer than all the files that are being
  // updated. Oh, well. What's the big deal then? How do we fix that? If it is a
  // server install, we demand that you maintain your clock. If it is a desktop
  // install, we can comb the entire database, because how big is it going to
  // be?
  //
  // Hmm... What are you going to do? This is why people like servers.
  //
  // ### Merging
  //
  // **TODO**: Great example floating around. Imagine that you've implemented
  // MVCC. You're always appending, until it is time to vacuum. When you vacuum,
  // you're deleting all over the place. You may as well do a table scan. You
  // might choose to iterate through the leaf pages.  You may have kept track of
  // where records have been stored since the last vacuum, so if you have a
  // terabyte large table, you're only vacuum the pages that need it.
  //
  // Merge is from right to left. When we merge we always merge a page into its
  // left sibling. If we've determined that a page from which records have been
  // deleted is supposed to merge with its right sibling, we apply our merge
  // algorithm to the right sibling, so that is is merged with its left sibling.
  //
  // When we compare a page from which records have been deleted against its
  // siblings, if the left sibling is to be merged, we use the page itself, the
  // middle page in our comparison. If the middle page is to merge with the
  // right page, we use the right page.
  //
  // To merge a leaf page, we start by obtaining the key value of the first
  // record. We can do this by acquiring a read lock on the page, without
  // performing a descent. The balancer gets to break some rules since it knows
  // that we know that the b&#x2011;tree is not being otherwise balanced.
  //
  // With that key, we descend the b&#x2011;tree. We know that the key value
  // cannot change, because it is the balancer that alters keys. The first
  // record may be deleted by editing, but a ghost of the first record is
  // preserved for the key value, which is the key value of the page.
  //
  // When we encounter the key value in a branch page, we acquire an exclusive
  // lock the branch page. We can release our shared lock and acquire an
  // exclusive lock. We do not have retest conditions after the upgrade, because
  // only the balancer would change the keys in a branch page, and we're the
  // balancer.
  //
  // We then descend the child to the left of the key, instead of to the right
  // as we would ordinary. We descend to the left child acquiring, an exclusive
  // lock, but retaining our exclusive lock on branch page where we found our
  // key. We then descend to the right most child of every child page, acquiring
  // exclusive locks in the hand-over-hand fashion, until we reach a leaf page.
  // We are now at the left sibling of the page we want to merge.
  //
  // We've locked the branch page that contains the key exclusively so that we
  // can reassign the key. It will no longer be valid when the page is merged
  // into its left sibling because the first record is now somewhere in the
  // midst of the left sibling. We lock exclusively hand-over-hand thereafter to
  // squeeze out any shared locks. Our exclusive lock on the parent containing
  // the key prevents another descent from entering the sub&#x2011;tree where we
  // are performing the merge.
  //
  // We now proceed down the path to the merge page as we would ordinarily,
  // except that we acquire exclusive locks hand-over-hand instead of shared
  // locks. This will squeeze out any other descents.
  //
  // We retain the exclusive lock on the penultimate branch page. No other
  // descent will be able to visit this penultimate branch, because we've
  // blocked entry into the sub&#x2011;tree and squeeze out the other descents.
  // We still need to hold onto the exclusive lock, however, otherwise the page
  // might be discarded during a cache purge, which can happen concurrently.
  //
  // We append the records in the merge page to its left sibling. We remove the
  // address of the merged page from the penultimate page.
  //
  // If we've deleted the first child of the penultimate branch page, then we
  // delete the cached key of the new first child. The new first child is the
  // left-most child of the penultimate page. Its key, if it not the left-most
  // page of the entire tree, has been elevated to the exclusively locked branch
  // page where we encountered the merge page key. We don't want keys to gather
  // where they are not used. That is a memory leak.
  //
  // We clear the merge key from the branch page where we found it. The next
  // descent that needs it will look up the new merge key. If we found the merge
  // key in a penultimate page, we need to make sure to clear the key using the
  // page address we stashed, because the page is now deleted.
  //
  // #### Merging Parent Branches
  //
  // Once we've merged a leaf page, we check to see if the penultimate branch
  // page that lost a child can be merged with one of its siblings. The
  // procedure for merging branch pages other than the root branch page is the
  // same regardless of the depth of the branch page.
  //
  // We acquire the key for the left most page in the sub&#x2011;tree underneath
  // the branch page. We do this by following the left most children until we
  // reach a leaf page. We use that key to descend the tree.
  //
  // we lock the page exclusively. We retain that lock for the duration of the
  // merge.
  //
  // When we encounter the key, we descent the child to the left of the key,
  // then we decent the right most child of every page until we reach the page
  // at the same depth as the merge page. That is the left sibling of the merge
  // page.
  //
  // We can then obtain a size for the left sibling, the merge and the right
  // sibling of the merge. If we are able to merge, we choose a merge page to
  // merge that page into the left sibling.
  //
  // We now descend the tree with the key for the merge page. We lock that page
  // exclusively. We go left then right to the level of the left sibling. We go
  // right then left to reach the merge page. (We're using page addresses to
  // know that we've reached the merge page, the key is going to only be useful
  // to find path on takes to find the left sibling.) We can then copy append
  // addresses to the left sibling. Remove the merge sibling from its parent.
  // Delete the key from where we found it, so it can be looked up again.
  //
  // Before we lose track of the sub&#x2011;tree we're in, we descend to the
  // potentially new left most leaf of the parent, and obtain its key to repeat
  // the process.
  //
  // #### Filling the Root Page
  //
  // If the parent is the root page, we only do something special when the root
  // page reaches one child and no keys. At that point, the one child becomes
  // the root. We will have deleted the last key, merged everything to the left.
  //
  // We descend again, locking the root. We lock the one child of the root. We
  // copy the contents of the one root child into the root and delete the child.
  //
  // This will decrease the height of the b&#x2011;tree by one.
  //
  // #### Deleting Pages
  //
  // A page deletion is simply a merge where we prefer to use the empty page as
  // the merge page. We have to make an exception when the empty page is the
  // left most page in the entire tree, which is not uncommon for time series
  // data where the oldest records are regularly purged.
  //
  // #### Purging Deleted First Keys
  //
  // Now we merge the parents. We find a penultimate page by the key of the left
  // most leaf. Similar go left, then get the up to three pages. See if they
  // will fit. Keep them around in cache. You may visit them again soon.
  //
  // If they fit, then you merge them. Lock exclusively the form page where you
  // found the key. Move left into the right. Rewriting. Remove the key from the
  // parent. You will have it locked. Delete the key.
  //
  // Then, get the left most leaf key. Okay there is only one thread balancing,
  // so we will have a consistent depth. This is merge.
  //
  // Delete the key to trigger the lookup.
  //
  // #### Deleted First Keys
  //
  // We fix deleted first keys at balance. Descend locking the key when we see
  // it. Mark it deleted forever. Then delete the key. It will get looked up
  // again.
  //
  // We split recursively. Split and put into the parent. If the parent is ready
  // to split, descend the tree locking the parent of the parent exclusively.
  // We'll track where that is. No one else is changing the height of the tree.
  // Only one thread is changing the height of the tree.
  //
  // We will create a plan to merge and split. We execute our plan. If we reach
  // a place where our plan is invalid, we requeue, but only if it is invalid.
  // If it is not invalid, only different, we continue with our merge, or our
  // split.
  //
  // This give us a potential for live lock. We're constantly creating plans to
  // merge, that are invalidated, so we create plans and those are invalidated.
  //
  // Our descent of the tree to balance will be evented anyway. We can probably
  // make our calculation evented. We were fretting that we'd exacerbate the
  // live lock problem. Live lock is a problem if it is a problem. There is no
  // real gauntlet to run. The user can determine if balance will live lock. If
  // there are a great many operations, then balance, wait a while, then
  // balance, wait a while. It is up the end user.
  //
  // The end user can use the b&#x2011;tree a map, tucking in values, getting
  // them out. Or else, as an index, to scan, perform table scans. We'll figure
  // that out.
  //
  // Now I have an API problem. The client will have to know about pages to work
  // with them. We can iterate through them, in a table scan. We can implement a
  // merge. We probably need an intelligent cursor, or a reporting cursor.

  // There has been a desire second guess the most-recently used list. There is
  // a desire to link nodes to the back of the list or suspend purges.
  //
  // There is a desire to cache the addresses of the left sibling pages when
  // possible, so I wouldn't have to descend the tree. Except that the
  // most-recently used list works hand in hand with b&#x2011;tree descent. The
  // higher levels of the tree are kept in memory, because they are more
  // frequently visited than lower levels. To much iteration along one level
  // threatens to purge other levels.
  //
  // One can imagine that when balancing b&#x2011;tree that has been left
  // unbalanced for a long time, reading in many unbalanced leaf pages will
  // cause the first ones to flush, which is a pity, since we'll probably need
  // one of them.
  //
  // Perhaps we suspect a page needs to be split but it doesn't. If the balancer
  // was the one to load the page, simply to determine that nothing needs to be
  // done, their is a desire to expedite the removal of the page from the cache.
  //
  // There are so many desires. It makes one giddy with thoughts of premature
  // optimization.
  //
  // We're going to descent the tree to find our left sibling to exercise the
  // most-recently used cache. We are not going to second guess it. We're going
  // to defer to the algorithms. The simpler the code, the more trust you can
  // have in the code, the more likely your code will be adopted. A wide user
  // base can inform decisions on optimization. There is always a core of what
  // your application needs to do, and Strata needs to search and edit records.
  //
  // Balancing the tree is maintenance. The balancer can take its time.

    // **TODO**: Uh, no. You can kind of launch this whenever the who, so long
    // as you do not launch more than one at a time. Use a callback. The
    // callback can record your errors to an error log. Do note that balance is
    // always concurrent, though. Makes no sense to try to run more than one at
    // a time, or it doesn't make sense to run a balance when a balance is
    // running, or rather, it doesn't make sense to make it a matter of running
    // one after each insert. Horrible writing here. Do not use.

    // **TODO**: Once loaded, and marked as part of the balancer, we can do our
    // calculations in one fell swoop. This triggers the consternation over what

    // **TODO**: What is the procedure for vacuuming deleted keys? &mdash; We
    // check every page that has been added to the balancer, regardless of
    // whether it has grown, shrunk or returned to its original reported size.
    // If the page is to be deleted, because the leaf page is empty, that
    // negates any fussing with the key. Same goes for the case where the page
    // is to be merged.

    // Ah, also, when we do load these, when we want to get them from the cache,
    // we don't really need them to be loaded. We should reach in a probe the
    // cache ourselves. My former Java self would have to spend three days
    // thinking about encapsulation, probably create a new sub-project. Agony.

    // Balancing will continue until morale improves. It may feel like a race
    // condition, but that can't be helped. There may be degenerate use cases
    // where the b&#x2011;tree cannot reach a balanced state. Inserts and
    // deletes may be taking a set of pages from needing split to needing merge
    // faster than the balance plan can figure it, and the balance operations
    // can make it so.

    // The balance plan is optimistic. It creates a plan based on the state of
    // the tree a specific point in time. While implementing the plan, however,
    // the state of the tree may change, invalidating aspects of the plan. In
    // this case, an operation will be canceled. When an operation is canceled,
    // we add the canceled pages to the next balancer.

    // **TODO**: Tracking the difference means we can short cut planning, if the
    // page has only grown. This is a short cut. We consider its use carefully.
    // We are not capricious with it. We are okay with having to load the
    // sibling page lengths to check for merge. A split will lead to a
    // subsequent balance plan that will load four pages. In that regard, splits
    // are not cheaper than merges.

    // No. Race condition. We want to gather all the pages in memory, so we can
    // evaluate them, without someone else changing them. We add a page because
    // it has grown, but then, when we imagine that we've gathered all the pages
    // necessary, it turns out that in the mean time, that page has shrunk so
    // that it is now too small. We could create an outer loop that keeps on
    // referencing cache entries until all are available, but then you have an
    // outer strange condition where you might load the entire b&#x2011;tree,
