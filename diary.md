When we last looked as this, apparently we where working through the split, so
we need to continue with it by first draining the root, then splitting a branch.

Also, I believe I left off by porting to Python and Crystal, so rabbit holes.

Seems like the next thing to do is to create a Strata with a split size of 4 and
attempt to get it to drain the root, which means writing drain the root. While
I'm at it, I'm going to attempt to document all these asynchronous queues.
